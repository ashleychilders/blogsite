**Comments**

- The plug-in I used for my site is the contact form.
- On my posts page the two bottom boxes that say sample site are placeholders for now until I can get more photos to add to my other posts.
- I changed my index page to include the post summary below it. I thought the page looked too empty without this. My post page used the elements of layout initially planned for my index page.
- My about page was the same was my wireframe and mock-up.
