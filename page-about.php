          <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Childers, thank you for checking out my Web Interactivity and Engagement blog site.</p>

          <p>This is a collection of posts that I have composed as part of a course requirement for my studies  as a  graduate student at the University of Florida in the Web Design and Online Communication program.
            When not busy with school projects, you can find me  at The World Bank
            headquarters in the Printing and Multimedia Department where I manage projects related to print and digital media.</p>

          <p>Outside of work I enjoy volunteering and spending time with my husband, Daniel and fur baby, Celine.
            We currently reside in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, DC. I have been a member of the Junior League of Washington
            for 8 years where I assist with programs related to promoting literacy in the Washington, DC area. Weekly I volunteer at The Kennedy Center
            as a Multimedia Broadcaster where I assist with video recording for the performances on the Millennium Stage.</p>

          <p>I have been working in the printing and publishing industries for over 10 years and would love to transition into a role solely devoted to online communications.</p>
